# py5mon

This project is basicly no longer maintained. I've moved it here from LaunchPad in an attempt to gather most of my public code in one place. It used to live at https://launchpad.net/py5mon

## Description
py5mon is a Python script to decode CCIR (selcall, 5-tone).
It uses pyaudio and numpy.

Supports both input from WAV-files (22050Hz mono 16bit) and line-in/microphone.
